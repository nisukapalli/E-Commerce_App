# E-Commerce_App

This project is a full-stack web application that integrates an e-commerce site with a blog system. The database uses SQL-base storage for user information (usernames and hashed passwords), login attempt data, blog posts, merchandise details. The frontend is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Key frontend features include a navigation bar, login system, blog posts, and merch page. The backend is powered by PHP, which processes user requests, handles authentication, and interacts with the database. Blog posts are stored and retrieved dynamically, and new posts are submitted without refreshing the page. The backend also validates purchases, updates inventory, and handles credit transactions securely. In addition, the app uses AJAX for API-like features such as fetching/submitting blog posts and validating coupons.
